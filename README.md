# paseVGA
An emulation of the ZXSpectrum computer on an ESP32 and VGA Screen

VGA Driver is from ESP32Lib by BitLuni

Z80 core is by Marcel de Kogel

Will load SNA snapshots from SDCard


Bugs: 

Fixed problem with SNA not loading, it was due to swapped registers in the loading

A much better extension of this code is available in the project from Ramon Martinez:
